# DigitalOcean Cassandra Multi-Node Vagrantfile

## Deploy
* Fill out VAGRANT_TOKEN in Vagrantfile with your Digital Ocean API key
* Change the Digital Ocean instance size to something higher than 1gb, as 1gb is pretty low
* type vagrant up

## Note
* Seed list is generated by sending IP addresses to a key-value store. Cluster Name and Private IP is only saved for 5 minutes. The Key Value store is public, but only used for this project. This Project is part of my Online DevOps Training
